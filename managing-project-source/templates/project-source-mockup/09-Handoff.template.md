# 09 — Handoff

```text
Handoff From / To
Previous Handoff

Current Phase / State
Completed Work

Formal Drafts / WIP
Active ACT / ISS / DRIFT / CONFLICT
Active RISK / ASM / DEP / MS / OUT / CR / GATE when applicable
Technical / Deployment warnings
Source/Docker known variance

Material Persistence State: PERSISTED | PERSISTENCE_PENDING | NOT_APPLICABLE

Project Location Binding / Local Workspace / File Storage Binding Reference: active FRAMEWORK-001 (no independent repo/folder/path/storage authority copy)
Bootstrap Location Mismatch / Freshness Warning when material
Observed MCP execution path/workspace evidence when needed
File Storage routing reference by storage_key/content scope/provider/source-native pointer when continuation requires external storage
Observed Repository Identity when material
Current Work Branch / Worktree
Verified HEAD SHA

```

Use this as a compact continuation contract. Do not turn Handoff into an MCP transcript, raw tool log, search dump, full diff archive, or private intermediate-reasoning store.

Continuation invariants:

```text
Exact Next Action = ไม่มีขั้นตอนถัดไป → Chat Continuity = START_NEW_CHAT
Chat Continuity = CONTINUE_CURRENT_CHAT → concrete Exact Next Action required
Material Persistence State = PERSISTENCE_PENDING → CONTINUE_CURRENT_CHAT + concrete persistence/recovery action
```

When continuation depends on GitHub/Drive/local/File Storage routing, reference the active `FRAMEWORK-001` Project Location Binding and source-native durable identities. `09` does not persist an independent Bootstrap Location Block, repository/workspace binding, or File Storage binding authority; current branch/worktree/HEAD remains observed dynamic evidence.
Lifecycle: `DRAFT → OFFERED → ACKNOWLEDGED → ACCEPTED → SUPERSEDED`.

**Resume Block (latest checkpoint):**

```text
Task: <TASK/ACT id> | Done: <last completed step> | Next: <exact next step> | Blockers: <none or list> | Envelope: <ENV-* or none>
```
